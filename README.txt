Two (it takes two to Django), mini subframework user registration and authentication package

Django doesn't provide a lot of nice out of the box user registration/authentication functionality. Integration with external authentication sources such as openid, browserid, oauth, twitter, facebook and linkedin are scattered. two.userauth attempts to solve this.

two.userauth is built on the two.ol Django mini subframework.
